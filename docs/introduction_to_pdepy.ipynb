    "- User Friendly  \n",
    "Whatever type of PDE the user wants to solve, all he/she needs to do is to set the boundary condition, plug PDE into the solver, and finally call the function **solve()**. No need to memorize tons of APIs, since the solver will automatically detect the type of the PDE, whether its domain is regular, etc., and select the appropriate algorithm for you.  \n",

    "- Extensible & Easy to Extend  \n",
    "It's impossible that the library will meet all needs from its users, e.g., higher-order differential operators, more accurate approximation, etc. So when I was designing this library, I made it extremely easy to add new operators, or to modify the existing numerical stencil.  \n",

    "## src.util.diff_operators\n",
    "There are two child packages __core__ and __impl__ inside it. **diff_operators.core** contains the most generic operators:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class diff_operator(object):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, stencil, coefficient = lambda x, y: 1, is_time_dependent = False):\n",
    "        # a list of tuple whose first element is relative position of node in the stencil, \n",

    "```\n",
    "It's intuitive that the time-dependent operator class is a subclass of usual operator class. And I make the type of coefficient be a lambda function, which **allows the coefficient before the operator to be either a function g(x, y) or a constant**.  \n",
    "Then let's take a look at concrete operators in **diff_operators.impl**.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ddx(diff_op.diff_operator):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, dx, coefficient = lambda x, y: 1):\n",
    "        super().__init__([((-1, 0), -1/(2*dx)), ((1, 0), 1/(2*dx))], coefficient)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The first argument $[((-1, 0), -1/(2*dx)), ((1, 0), 1/(2*dx))]$ represents the stencil we used to approximate $\\frac{du}{dx}$, which is $\\frac{u(x+\\Delta x, y)-u(x-\\Delta x, y)}{2\\Delta x}\\sim \\frac{du}{dx} + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta x^2)$.   \n",
    "From this example, we can see that $(-1, 0)$ represents $(x-\\Delta x, y)$ and $-1/(2*dx)$ represents $-\\frac{1}{2\\Delta x}$.   \n",
    "Also note that the lambda function **coefficient** means the coefficient before this operator, e.g., if we have $-sin(x)sin(y)\\frac{du}{dx}$, the **coefficient** would be __lambda x, y: -math.sin(x)\\*math.sin(y)__.\n",
    "## src.util.diff_op_expression\n",
    "This is a class for storing all the operators in a PDE. It can be seen as a list that is able to analyze what type of PDE is inputed. \n",
    "## src.util.domain_conditions\n",
    "This is one of the boundary condition that users have to fill in. The arguments' names are self-explanatory.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class dirichlet_bc(bc.boundary_condition):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, inDomain, onBoundary, getBoundaryValue, domain, getNearestPoint = (None, None)):\n",
