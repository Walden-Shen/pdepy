    "This is a solver for linear (constant/variable coefficient) time-dependent 1D/2D PDEs, i.e., PDEs that can be written in the form of $\\mathcal{L}u=f$, where $\\mathcal{L}$ is a linear combination of $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}, \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y}, \\dots\\}$ whose coefficients __can be either a constant or a function $g(x, y)$__. Additionally, users are free to add any other operators.   \n",
    "Note: For 1D problems, the Crank-Nicolson method is used by default. For 2D problems, the explicit method is applied. This means that users have to apply smaller time steps when they are solving 2D problems, while there is no such constraint for 1D problems.  \n",
